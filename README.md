# Parallel-and-Distributed-Deep-Learning

This GitHub repository is in support of my thesis "Parallel and Distributed Deep Learning and its Application in TensorFlow". The example codes of different distributed strategies in TensorFlow are provided in this repository. These include MirroredStrategy, MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy, ParameterServerStrategy, and Horovod.
